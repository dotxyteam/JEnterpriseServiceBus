ABOUT MAPPINGS
--------------
Any source node can be mapped to a target node, even if the types are
incompatible. Actually the intent of the developer may be to generate a base
expression and modify it. 
The role of the UI is to automate common tasks,
provide simpler representations of data, and warn the developer early when
something is wrong. 
If a specific mapping is likely to be done, the it should
be done systematically. If there is a doubt, then the UI should propose the
common options. Note that if a function is complex, the function editor
should be used to compose it rather than the mappings editor. Thus there is
no need to allow to specify all the possible logics in the mappings editor.
