- strategy: 
	. focus on an original main feature and make it work
	. implement quickly and minimally all the other features
	. release a first version
	. advertise
	. improve the features
- show parameter name in ObjectSpecification
- allow to have dynamic input and output for activities like JDBCQuesry etc 
- add script edition assistance:
	. allow to select a data source node that will generate a script
- add XML support
	. generate automatically classes from XSD to parse and render ???
- enhance the diagram editor
- add things like groups (for repetition, etc) and conditionnal transitions for steps
- comment the code
- add built-in activities (file, jdbc, jms, data format, .. activities)
- allow to map fields graphically 
- allow to create and organize plans
- allow to create and share resources (JDBCConnection, etc)
- allow to start plan execution on event (timer, file poller, etc)
- allow to extend the framework by adding custom activities
- allow to debug
- allow to deploy and execute a project outside of the designer in a production environment
- allow to monitor the execution of deployed projects
- offer windows and linux versions
- change the JRE/JDK: use OpenJDK or ...
- using ObjectSpecification to create activities is not necessarily a good idea:
the activity configuration may not be known at design time. It would prevent
from determining contextual or dynamic input and output of activities that
would depend on a concrete configuration. For instance, you cannot 
determine the structure of a JDBC query result set without using the 
concrete JDBC connection resource to connect to the database and fetch
the metadata of the query result. TIBCO BW solves this problem by using 2 kinds
of configuration for each activity: the static configuration for which values
are known during the design phase, and the dynamic configuration for which
values will be determined during the execution phase. Note that some 
configuration items are both static and dynamic and the dynamic setting
overrides the static setting. The solution my be to force activity developers
to provides 3 classes: an ActivityBuiler class, an Activity class and an 
ActivityResult class.
