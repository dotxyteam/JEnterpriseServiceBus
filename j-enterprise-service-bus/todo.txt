- strategy: 
	. focus on an original main feature and make it work
	. implement quickly and minimally all the other features
		* bug-fixes, new features or refactorings that are risky (time-consuming,
		difficult to test and stabilize) must be circumvented using simple/quick
		solutions and postponed.
		* small features that are easy and quick to implement but bring a lot of 
		value (by adding use cases, ..) must be implemented.
	. document quickly (javadoc, manual) to avoid design errors
	. add at least some small automated tests to avoid blocking implementation errors
		* write 1 test by palette/category (XML, JDBC, ...)
		* write the test scenarii with jesb itsel (to traverse as many layers as possible)
	. release a first version
	. advertise
	. improve the features
	. mandatory:
		* allow to deploy and run outside the debugger
		* allow to extend easily by:
			# creating new operations
			# extending existing operations
	. REMARK: it is impossible for only few persons to provide an enterprise-ready
	and bug-free set of features (operations, activators, ...). The goal must 
	then be to provide extensibility capabilities as a core feature and address
	very specific (niche) needs like mainframe interactions, mq, etc.    
	. REMARK: if an important feature is missing and costly to implement, 
	it's best to first implement a quick workaround, release it, and then gradually 
	implement the final solution. It's also essential have a branch dedicated to 
	maintaining at least the latest	stable version, in order to include bug fixes 
	discovered during the feature addition process.
- missing LoopCompositeStep documentation
- move Runtime.getXstream() to a generic XStream agnostic Solution.getSerializer()
- Runner plan executors and step crossings will remain and fill the memory
- allow to use the JESB API to access the current execution context and perform some actions
- add ExecutePlan.fork option ???
- add an ExecutePlan option to dynamically select the target plan
(maybe allow to do it via the JESB API)
- fix date/time display issues due to java.util.Date picking the current local time zone
(not the historical one)
- allow to read big files
- JDBC Query: allow to use subsets
- JDBC Procedure Call: allow to get additional resultSet ???
- allow to select *File.charsetName options
- allow to create template operations (ex: for dynamic jdbc suery statement) ???
(maybe allow to do it via the JESB API)
- simplify the reuse of the JESB API:
	- add method InitializerFacade.getChild(String displayString).
	- add method RootInstanceBuilder.getRootInstantiationFacade()
- factorize activators error handling to prevent unexpected deactivation
(may be by adding service-oriented features to the ACtivator class)
- improve exception management:
	. add OperationBuilder#getExceptionClassByIdentifier() 
	. allow to choose one of these exception identifiers (+ default) from error transitions
	. add Activator#getExceptionClassByIdentifier()
	. allow to add custom entries for 'Operate' activators
	. allow to choose one of these exception identifiers from 'Fail' operations
	. allow to specify an additional condition for error transitions 
	(can already be expressed by adding a transition) ???
	. replace REST and SOAP ResponseException by derived specific exceptions
- add a welcome image ???
- allow to have environment variables having array type
- allow to have encrypted (password) environment settings
- maybe change the project name since ESBs are not popular anymore
- allow SSL for HTTPServer ???
(can be managed by a reverse proxy)
- allow authentication for HTTP-based request operations ??? 
(can be managed by a reverse proxy)
- configure heapdump on OOM by default ???
- create a basic WSDL/OAD generator ???
- allow to view APIs (SOAP/REST) documentation URL in the GUI ???
(can already be seen in the logs)
- add other built-in activities (jms, data format, ...)
- cloud compatibility
- add JDBC connection/operation timeout options
- rename JDBC* operations to DB* or Database* or SQL* ???
- allow to ignore errors ???
- allow to use a custom profile to debug (must be able to view the changed variable 
values) ???
(profiles can now be exported/imported)
- allow to run (not debug) from the designer
- allow to store and view plan executions in deployed mode
- manage JDBC connection pools
- add RetryOnErrorCompositeStep(attemps, delay, delayGrowth)
- add basic HTTP operation/activators 
- allow to share assets between solutions
- allow to process REST XML (not JSON) message payloads 
- deleting the whole solution folder before saving is risky. 
find a solution (merge files and folders ???)..  
- improve the UI design:
	. add a banner ???
	. get inspiration from TIBCO Flogo
- allow to add debug breakpoints
- add security & advanced HTTP server options (see https://docs.tibco.com/pub/activematrix_businessworks/6.7.0/doc/html/GUID-E7A7A6BD-20C7-496D-9F75-868B6F82FD1E.html)
- allow to add comment boxes to plan diagrams
- allow to optimize a debug session by:
	. disabling animations
	. disabling the step occurrences collection
	. disabling all breakpoints
- allow to monitor the execution of deployed projects
- InstanceBuilder misses 'with var' feature
- InstanceBuilder: new var names not chosen according preceding steps
- diagram improvements:
	. connections are not straight and nice ???
- manage renamings ???
- what if 2 variables have the same name ?
- InstantiationUtils.extractRelativeTypeNameVariablePart() must never find multiple
different parts
- Check that UnexpectedError is not used for exceptions that are not really related to JESB bugs
Solution bugs are not JESB bugs. It should be possible to debug erroneous solution.
- add support to Iterable for ListItemReplication.iterationListValue
- alternatives: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Talend/comments/19cvxwf/talend_open_source_is_being_discontinued/
- adjust selection after a case (switch) is moved down/up
- allow to change default PathExplorer node type (it should generate a cast expression)
- verify (during persistence probably) that:
	. every asset is isolated (does not have other asset reference)
	. there is no persisted inner class that hold a reference to the enclosing class instance (not sure) ???
- do System.exit() when closing the GUI to ensure there is no running thread (due to a buggy http server, etc)
- diagram improvements:
	. zoom
- Switch/Cases feature issues:
	. should not allow to remove all switch/cases managed elements ???
- generate expressions that do not crash because of a null pointer ???
- add connectors for:
	. JMS
	. Kafka
- check dependencies vulnerabilities and change versions ???
- improve JDBCQueryActivity:
	. check parameter type mappings
- some modifications can disappear from the UI when 
InstanceBuilder.(className|selectedConstructorSignature) are modified. It may be better
to display incoherent nodes with an error marker ???
