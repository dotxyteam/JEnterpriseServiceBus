- strategy: 
	. focus on an original main feature and make it work
	. implement quickly and minimally all the other features
	. release a first version
	. advertise
	. improve the features
- add things like 
	. groups 
		* for repetition: loop while with the ability to break
			# allow to copy/cut and paste into loop composite
			# allow to create a parent loop for the current selection
		* etc 
	. conditional transitions for steps
- improve the step list view (sort, add hierarchy, ...)
- error marker do not disappear when deselecting and selecting a plan while
ExecutePlan.inputBuilder is filled
- allow to build and reference shared structures
- allow to start plan execution on event (timer, file poller, etc)
- create and display a Sub-PlanExecutor for each sub-plan execution
- add an "Evaluate" activity (like BW "Mapper" activity
- allow to manage exceptions
- to ease co-working and version control, plans and resources must be stored in separate files  
- add validation
- optimize functions (do not recompile systematically)
- allow to deploy and execute a project outside of the designer in a production environment
- allow to monitor the execution of deployed projects
- allow to extend the framework by adding custom activities
- allow to specify custom activity builder UI details through the code
- InstanceBuilder misses 'with var'
- InstanceBuilder: new var names not chosen according preceding steps
- allow to provide plan input through the debugger
- diagram improvements:
	. connections are not straight and nice
- prevent or warn about multiply defined transitions
- manage renamings
- Plan.isPreviousStep() too CPU greedy
- what if 2 variables have the same name ?
- add other built-in activities (file, jdbc, jms, data format, ...)
- replace "Assist..." by an icon ???
- rename activity classes (remove 'Activity' suffix) ???
- rename Activities to Operations
- add support to Iterable for ListItemReplication.iterationListValue
- alternatives: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Talend/comments/19cvxwf/talend_open_source_is_being_discontinued/
- adjust selection after a case (switch) is moved down/up
- integrated log window (console)
- allow to change default PathExplorer node type (it should generate a cast expression)
- diagram improvements:
	. zoom
- Switch/Cases feature issues:
	. should not allow to remove all switch/cases managed elements ???
- control InstanceBuilder.typeName updates ??? (the new type should inherit from the
normal type)
- wrap function editor lines ???
- generate expressions that do not crash because of a null pointer ???
- allow to trace errors origin
- add XML/JSON support
	. generate automatically classes from schemas to parse and render ???
- allow to serve/call rest/soap web services
- Structure.Element.multiple= true should generate a list instead of an array ???
- UI improvements:
	. banner ???
- add connectors for:
	. JMS
	. Kafka
- JDBCConnection:
	. driver jars location ???
- comment the code
- allow to view resources full path
- offer windows and linux versions
- change the JRE/JDK: use OpenJDK or ...
- improve JDBCQueryActivity:
	. check parameter type mappings
	. can generate automatically parameter definitions ???
	. should automatically retrieve result columns ???
- some modifications can disappear from the UI when 
InstanceBuilder.(className|selectedConstructorSignature) are modified. It may be better
to display incoherent nodes with an error marker
- change the look and feel (maybe the windows look and feel would be good)
