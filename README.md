# Overview

It is a Java-based open source visual development platform allowing to automate business processes and connect heterogeneous applicative systems. 

It has a graphical user interface for process modeling and debugging.

The dynamism/intelligence of processes is expressed through (essentially) generated Java code snippets, which eliminates the need to learn any specific syntax.

Extensibility is almost a key feature allowing any user to model and mostly generate plugins complementing core features as needed.


# Use Cases

- Integrating heterogeneous applications (REST/SOAP, XML, database, ...)
- Developing ETL (extract, transform, and load) jobs
- Orchestrating business processes
- …

# Advantages

- Visual process development (low code) and debugging
- Simplified extensibility (plugins generator available) 

# Compatibility

Tested on Windows & Linux.

# Licensing

It is distributed under this
[license](https://github.com/dotxyteam/JEnterpriseServiceBus/blob/master/j-enterprise-service-bus/LICENSE).

# Concepts

- JESB allows to develop one **solution** at a time.
- Each **solution** is composed of **plans** and **resources**.
- Each **plan** has its own activation mode (**activator**).
- **Resources** are shared configurations referenced by **plans** or other **resources**.
