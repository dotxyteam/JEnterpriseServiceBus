# JEnterpriseServiceBus
It is an open source visual development platform allowing to automate business processes and connect heterogeneous applicative systems. 

It has a graphical user interface for process modeling and debugging. 
The dynamism/intelligence of processes is expressed through (essentially) generated Java code snippets, which eliminates the need to learn any specific syntax. 
Extensibility is a key feature, allowing any user to model and mostly generate plugins, complementing native functionality as needed.
