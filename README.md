# JEnterpriseServiceBus
It is an open source visual development platform based on Java.
It allows for the automation of business processes and the connection of heterogeneous applicative systems. 

It has a graphical user interface for process modeling and debugging. 
The dynamism of the processes is expressed through essentially generated Java code snippets, which eliminates the need to learn any specific syntax. 
Extensibility is a key feature, allowing any user to model and mostly generate plugins, complementing native functionality as needed.
